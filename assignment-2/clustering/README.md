# Clustergin

Goal: find out the maximum spacing of a 4-clustering.

```
The input file describes a distance function (equivalently, a complete graph with edge costs). It has the following format:

[number_of_nodes]

[edge 1 node 1] [edge 1 node 2] [edge 1 cost]

[edge 2 node 1] [edge 2 node 2] [edge 2 cost]

...

There is one edge  for each choice of , where  is the number of nodes.

For example, the third line of the file is "1 3 5250", indicating that the distance between nodes 1 and 3 (equivalently, the cost of the edge (1,3)) is 5250.
